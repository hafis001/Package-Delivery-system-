How the script works:
User Input:

The script first asks for the number of checkpoints.
Then, for each checkpoint, the user is asked to provide:
The name of the checkpoint.
The name of the receiver.
The date when the package reached that checkpoint.
Package Movement:

The package starts from the first checkpoint and moves to the next one.
For each checkpoint:
The receiver’s name and the date when the package reached there are displayed.
The current time and date are shown as if the package has just arrived at that checkpoint.
There is a simulated time delay of 2 seconds (time.sleep(2)) to mimic real-time tracking.
The package’s next checkpoint arrival time is incremented by one day for simplicity.
Termination:

The process continues until the package reaches its final checkpoint (destination).
Once the last checkpoint is reached, the script prints a message that tracking is complete.
